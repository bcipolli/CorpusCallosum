Simulations, using Ringo et al. (1994) as a starting point, which:
* Show that the Ringo results only matter for the difference between the intra-hemispheric and inter-hemispheric conduction delays.
* Implement axon conduction delay noise
* Show that axon noise can cause interhemispheric independence
* Show that axon noise can suppress, or enhance, the development of lateralization, based on input/output lateralization.
